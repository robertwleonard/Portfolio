            The Forest Awakens is the tale of young Colby Chemil, a kid used to
            being different. When the headmaster of his school disappears without
            warning, a new headmaster steps in. One with brutal new tactics that
            force Colby to flee for his life. On his travels, the forest itself
            seems to guide him to answers about his past. In his absence, his two
            best friends take it upon themselves to find their old headmaster and
            discover how he was so quietly deposed.

            The Draknor Kingdom has been betrayed, and the high king slain in his
            sleep. Now young Kaiyren Narrium must step into her role as High Queen
            of all Draknor. To make matters worse the kingdom must now prepare for
            war against the barbarian tribes of the south, something so rare the
            new queen has never seen it in her lifetime. It is time for the Draknor
            Society to step up once again to their roles as guardians.

            Tuesday Night Stories was a weekly podcast of stories I wrote. Another
            programmer on DraknorMUD, David Carroll, did all the narration for the
            stories. We hosted it ourselves, and added it to numerous podcast sites
            such as ITunes. We had to end the run after two seasons due to time constraints. In all,
            TNS consisted of nine short stories, spread out over fifty four episodes.
