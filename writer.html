            Tuesday Night Stories was a weekly podcast of stories I wrote. Another
            programmer on DraknorMUD, David Carroll, did all the narration for the
            stories. We hosted it ourselves, and added it to numerous podcast sites
            such as ITunes. We had to end the run after two seasons due to time constraints. In all,
            TNS consisted of nine short stories, spread out over fifty four episodes.
